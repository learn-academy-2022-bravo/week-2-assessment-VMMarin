# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters are found inside parantheses - function declaration. Arguments are defined variables - real values

  Researched answer: Function parameters are vague (place holder) values listed in the function definition(parantheses) while the arguments are the true values passed to the function.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: . map acts on an array, requires a return 

  Researched answer: .map takes a function as an argument, acts on an array iterates, returns an array of the same length - a return is required, is not optional. Using .map without a return will ouput undefined.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: . map iterates on the array and returns an array of the same length, . filter iterates on an array, and returns a shortened array. 

  Researched answer: Essentially, .map generates an array modifies all elements of an array, and returns a new array with all elements modified. .filter filters out certain elements of an array based on given parameters and returns an array with only the filtered elements. 



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a set of instructions. Method is also a set of instructions, but is associated with objects

  Researched answer: Functions are reusable - dynamic - can be used repeatedly. Methods are not dynamic. Methods are assigned to an object and store instructions for that object. 



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Destructuring allows us to access certain properties of an object

  Researched answer: Destructuring assigns properties of an ojject to variables - allows us to access/extract those properties



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: Definitely a stretch! Not sure, but looking forward to researching this one! 

  Researched answer: Hoisting allows a variable to be used before it has been declared - declarations are moved to the top of the scope. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Parent-child relationship with objects - outline for objects - Class elements can be passed into / inherited by objects

2. React: Created by facebook for streamlined/ faster app capabilites - is a JS library for user interfaces

3. React state: built-in object used to contain component data

4. React lifecycle methods: has three phases: mounting, updating, unmounting. Mounting is setting uo the DOM, updating is the pase in which the component's props are changed, unmounting is the phase in which a component is removed from the DOM

5. DOM: Document Object Model - visual representation of webpage
